# CMOS Integrator – Cadence Virtuoso

This repository contains the design and simulation of a **CMOS integrator**
implemented using **Cadence Virtuoso**. The integrator is designed as a
fundamental building block for a **Sigma–Delta Modulator**.

## Tool Used
- Cadence Virtuoso (Analog Design Environment)

## Library Name
- integrator

## Cells Included
- **int** : CMOS integrator schematic and symbol  
- **int_tb** : Integrator testbench  
- **int_test** : Top-level transient and AC simulation  

## Simulations
- Transient analysis to verify integration behavior  
- AC analysis to verify frequency response  
- Input: Sinusoidal signal  
- Output: Integrated (ramp/filtered) waveform  

## Screenshots
The `screenshots/` folder contains:
- Integrator schematic  
- Transient response waveform  
- AC response plot  

## Project Team
This project was carried out as a **group mini-project**.
